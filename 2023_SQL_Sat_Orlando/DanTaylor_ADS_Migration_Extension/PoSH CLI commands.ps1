#Assessment
#Execuete the following CLI statement to run an assessment against your source SQL Server Instance you are migrating the databases from.

#SKU Reccomendation 
#Execute the following CLI to assess your source SQL Server Instance you are migrating the databases from.
#Be sure to execute against a representitve sample to obtain the best recommended SKU ( This is in Preview )
